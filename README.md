# Numerical Coherent Mode Decomposition: Validation and Applications

This repository contains the Python scripts used to generate the figures for the manuscript "Numerical Coherent Mode Decomposition: Validation and Applications" submitted to Physical Review A.

## Code Description

*   `partcohr3.py`: This script performs the validation simulations and generates the data and plots for Figures 1 through 5.
*   `tophat.py`: This script runs the "Trojan Horse" beam demonstration and generates the multi-panel plot for Figure 6.

## How to Run

The scripts can be run directly using a standard Python environment. The required libraries are common in scientific computing:

*   NumPy
*   SciPy
*   Matplotlib

To reproduce the figures, execute the scripts from your terminal:

```bash
python partcohr3.py
python tophat.py
